# Welcome to GrpLib!

GrpLib is a library for computational group theory problems. 
They are organised by problem and datasets of groups that prove difficult or slow.
The aim of GrpLib is to provide a place to add new problems and sets of groups that encounter it.
We hope that this will develop to a library of benchmark sets of groups and algorithms, is a first step to making computational group theory recomputable.
