# Welcome to GrpLib!

GrpLib is a library for computational group theory problems and for group generation. 
Each problem is presented with papers, and linked to the sets of groups that either are difficult to solve over, or the sets of groups on which the algorithms have been tested on.
Currently, the group generation code is in [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org), we encourage any languages to be used.

The aim of GrpLib is to provide a place to add new problems and new ways of generating groups.
We hope that this will develop to a library of benchmark sets of groups and algorithms, is a first step to making computational group theory recomputable.
